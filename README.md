# Implementing an Ensemble Convolutional Neural Network on Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar data and Sentinel-3 Radiometric data for the detecting of forest fires
This Github repository serves as an extension for the report  "Implementing an Ensemble Convolutional Neural Network on
Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar data and Sentinel-3 Radiometric data for the detecting of forest fires", made as a part of my MSc Eng. studies on Earth and Space Physcis and Engineering, with a specialisation in Earth Observation.

## Introduction:
- The ECNN automatically finds forest fires probabilities using geo-located Sentinel-1 SAR data and Sentinel-3 radiometry data.
- Focus of the project was not to get the best testing accuracy. Instead, the entire workflow should be developed(aquire data, process data, label data, define arcitecture, train models, get model results, test on new data, automate it all). 



An Ensemble Convolution Neural Network(ECNN) is a machine learning technique that can automatically extract features from arrays and use these features for classification problems. In an ECNN, it is possible to combine many type of data sets with the only requirement of them being comparable arrays. In this project, the Sentinel-1 SAR data and Sentinel-3 radiometric data has  be used to detect forest fires using such an ECNN. The entire framework of an ECNN is  described and implemented in Python using ESA SNAP to pre-process the data. It is argued that the ECNN was able to extract features that resembled the patterns of the fires. The framework is proved to work, and could be further improved or adjusted to other problems.


In short, the repository contains the entire implementation of an ECNN, starting with the acqusition of data, making the data set, labelling the data set, 
making an ECNN model, training the model and lastly using the model for new predictions.
Furthermore, an analysis of the Sentinel-1 IW GRD and Sentinel-3 L1 RBT SLSTR fire detection capabilities are made(a short one since focus is on the ECNN).

The framework works for the intended purposes. Many bugs exists, and problem occurs. Focus has not been on making the best product.

## Motivation
----------------------------
A growing need for advanced machine learning and deep learning algorithms is the motivating this project.
Here, the ECNN capabilities for Remote Sensing will be analyzed.
This is done in accordance with my studies, and the project is worth 10 ECTS points.

## Demonstration
Using the link above, images, models and implemneted modules can be downloaded, otherwise use gitclone.

To get a fire detection probability map, use the following function:
```python
prediction_map = cnn.get_prediction_one_image(folder_img='/content/drive/My Drive/syntese/data/cnn/images_testing/image_pair_1',folder_models='/content/drive/My Drive/syntese/data/cnn/models/new',verbose=1)
```
